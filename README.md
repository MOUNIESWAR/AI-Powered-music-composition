🎶 Harmony in Code: AI-Powered Music Composition
🚀 Welcome to Harmony in Code! This project pioneers the fusion of artificial intelligence and music composition, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to generate expressive piano melodies.

🎵 Introduction
In today's digital age, AI is reshaping creative fields, pushing the boundaries of artistic expression. Music, a deeply emotional and structured form of art, can now be composed by intelligent algorithms.

Our project, Harmony in Code, explores the fascinating intersection of AI and music, with a particular focus on piano compositions. By harnessing the power of deep learning, we aim to create emotionally rich and musically coherent pieces using artificial intelligence.

🤖 AI Meets Music: A New Era of Composition
🎼 Traditional music composition requires deep understanding, creativity, and technical expertise. However, AI-driven music generation enables:
✅ Automatic melody generation
✅ Learning from existing compositions
✅ Creative assistance for musicians

Using AI, we can analyze musical patterns, understand harmonies, and generate entirely new compositions that retain human-like musical structure.

🔥 Why LSTM? (Long Short-Term Memory)
To generate music, we use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a special type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). LSTMs excel in tasks involving sequential data, making them ideal for music generation.

🎯 LSTMs are effective because they:
🎵 Remember long-term dependencies in music
🎵 Capture complex note progressions and harmonies
🎵 Retain rhythmic patterns and musical structure

📌 Unlike standard RNNs, LSTMs prevent issues like vanishing gradients, ensuring that generated compositions remain cohesive and natural.

🎼 How It Works
🔹 Step 1: Train the LSTM model on existing piano compositions
🔹 Step 2: Identify patterns in melody, harmony, and rhythm
🔹 Step 3: Generate new, original piano compositions
🔹 Step 4: Convert AI-generated sequences into playable music files

🎧 The result? A beautifully crafted piece of AI-generated piano music!

📌 Key Features
✨ AI-generated piano melodies
✨ Uses deep learning (LSTM) for sequential music modeling
✨ Learns from existing compositions
✨ Outputs coherent, emotionally rich music

🎶 Our goal: To create AI-generated music that feels as expressive and compelling as human-composed pieces!

🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Expand to multiple instruments beyond piano
🔹 Integrate style transfer for various musical genres
